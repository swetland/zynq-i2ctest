Xilinx Zynq I2C Test

A simple experiment to sort out some techniques for developing with
Xilinx Vivado (2014.1) against the ZYBO development board.

- builds from commandline
- uses BSCANE2 JTAG block to provide host interaction

To talk to this, use the "i2c" tool in:
https://github.com/swetland/jtag-mpsse

To read the MAC address from the I2C EEPROM on ZYBO:
% i2c sw:a0 w:fa sw:a1 r r r r r r p 


Third Party Code Included:
  I2C Master from OpenCores (minus the wishbone interface)
